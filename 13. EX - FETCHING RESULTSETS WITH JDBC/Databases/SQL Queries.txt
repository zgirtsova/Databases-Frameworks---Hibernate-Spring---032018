-- 01. Initial Setup
-- Create new database called “MinionsDB” where we will keep information about our minions and villains. 
-- For each minion keep information about its name, age and town.  
-- Each town has name and information about in which country is located. 
-- Villains have name and evilness factor (good, bad, evil, super evil). 
-- Each minion can serve to several villains and each villain can have several minions to serve him. 
-- Fill all tables with at least 5 records each.

-- 02. Get Villains’ Names

-- minions of those who has more than 3 minions ordered descending by number of minions.

-- 4. Add Minion
-- Write a program that reads information about minion and its villain and adds
-- it to the database. In case the town of the minion is not in the database insert
-- it as well. In case the villain is not present in the database add him too with
-- default evilness factor of “evil”. Finally set the new minion to be servant of
-- the villain and villain. Print appropriate messages after each operation.
-- *Bonus task: Make sure all operations are executed successfully. 
-- In case of an error do not change the database.
